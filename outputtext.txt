six years before he became a famous soccer player so when he was a pizza boy had he been picked on a lot had he been bullied I'm sorry picked on means bullied it's it's the same meaning so to pick on someone and to bully someone it's the same meaning so had he been picked on when he was a pizza boy yes he had he had been bullied he had been picked on a lot when he was a pizza boy who had picked on him at that time Julia Roberts Julia Roberts had picked on him many times before he became a famous soccer player now after he became a soccer player what happened of course he got a ninja bodyguard did Julia Roberts continue to pick on or to bully him after he became a famous soccer player no no no no no she didn't she did not continue to bully him why not because he got a strong powerful ninja bodyguard and who was his ninja bodyguard obviously class that's right AJ AJ had been David Beckham's ninja bodyguard is AJ David Beckham's ninja bodyguard right now no no of course not why not well because now AJ is an English teacher AJ is not a bodyguard now but in the past had he been David Beckham's ninja bodyguard yes he had he had been David Beckham's ninja bodyguard but then AJ became an English teacher so he became an English teacher and is AJ still an English teacher now yes he is he's still an English teacher now so he had been David Beckham's ninja bodyguard then he became an English teacher and now AJ is still an English teacher ah yeah very very complicated story but you understand right now what about Julia Roberts why had Julia Roberts picked on poor little David

experiences when she was a child for example she had a cat when she was a child Julia Roberts had a cat a small cat what did Julia Roberts have when she was a child well she had a cat what kind of cat

Julia to make Julia become angry and mean and terrible well of class of course fritz had bullied poor Julia when she was very young he had bullied Julia again and again and again for many years why had fritz bullied Julia well of course because he was German he was a German dog that's why German students don't get angry it's just a joke just joking all right so why had he bullied Julia well of

the meaning better you need more repetition you need more deep learning so all you need to do is listen to this story again and again and again listen to it every day for one week or two weeks shout
